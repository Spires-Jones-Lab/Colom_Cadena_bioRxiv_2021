- Plaque distance: - plaque boundary is done from the original mask (not dilated).
		   - results are saved for each case while running.
- Colocalization:  - results are saved for each case while running.

190624
- Plaque distance: fixed distance calculations.

190624
- Colocalization: Parameters saved in an Excel file.
- Plaque distance: Fixed issue with empty images (no plaque or no objects).


190606
- Colocalization: Instead of percentage of objects, number of objects colocalizing.
- Segment_previsualize: Previsualization is the whole image, not cropp. Bug fixed.

- Alignment: removed .tif.tif issue.
- 3D filtering: faster way using object properties.
- Segmentation: fixed value threshold option added.
- Plaque distances: In case that there is no plaque (object<10000px), use central pixel.


190507
- Densities: Corrected calculations of objects/mm3
- Segmentation: Correction is now made from a mean NOT median value of the whole image (before were errors with dark images)

- Neuropil mask: - The area of neuropil was the oposite. Now it is fixed.
		 - New output: Object density in mm3 (depending of the resolution, asked at the begining).
- Plaque distances: - Neuropil marsk is applyed to all the channels.
        - Areas of each bin are calculated according to Neuropil mask + plaque Mask.
